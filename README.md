# Project-Sub250---Indomitus
Presenting India's sub 250 gram 5inch freestyle drone frame. 

This is the sub250 5inch freestyle frame which gives the adrenaline rush of the 5inch and also is ilicit. The design and the features are derived from various popular frames
and the "Ummagawd 2fiddy" and "Rotor Riot outlaw" are what inspired me. The frame has a unibody baseplate of 3mm (might change after thorough test) and the top plate is of thickness 2mm. One can easily fly 5.1 inch props. The motor mounting is in 12x12 configuration and the best suited motor would be the 2004 size motor. The frame has 20mm standoff.
